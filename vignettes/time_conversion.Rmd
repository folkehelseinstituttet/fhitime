We create the following functions to make it easier to work with date and times in different formats. 


For the input, we allow either a numeric (3) or string ("03", "2020-03"). 

For the output, the user need to specify whether numeric or string is required. Functions end with `c` returns a character output and `n` returns a double. 


```{r}
library(fhitime)
library(magrittr)
```


## Which year/week is it?

By default the functions returns the isoyear or isoweek of **today**. 

```{r}
isoyear_c()
isoyear_n()
isoweek_c()
isoweek_n()
# provide a date
isoyear_c('2021-01-01')
isoyear_n('2021-01-01')
isoweek_c('2021-01-01')
isoweek_n('2021-01-01')
```




## Get year/week from a `isoyearweek` string

```{r}
isoyearweek_to_isoyear_c("2021-02")
isoyearweek_to_isoyear_n("2021-02")
isoyearweek_to_week_c("2021-02")
isoyearweek_to_week_n("2021-02")
```


A list of `isoyearweek` can be accessed in the following way. 

```{r}
yrwk_19_20 <- world_dates_isoyearweek[year %in% c(2019, 2020)]
head(yrwk_19_20)
```
